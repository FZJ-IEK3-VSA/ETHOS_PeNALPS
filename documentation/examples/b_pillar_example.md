# Example: B-Pillar Production 
This example is based on the process description in {cite}`Neugebauer.2012` . It is for demonstration of the capabilities of EHTOS.PeNALPS and the results are not validated yet. {numref}`process_chain_visualization` 
shows the process which consists of the following 4 steps:
1. Blanking
2. Heating
3. Forming and quenching
4. Trimming

# Capacity
The material flow parameters are determined based on the weight of a single b-pillar and the turnover times of the Forming and quenching.

It is assumed that the B-Pillar has a weight of 6kg. This assumption is based on the reported weight of a standard design in {cite}`Pan.2010` which was 5.21 kg

The turnover times are used from {cite}`MezaGarcia.2019` . The transfer from the oven takes 6 seconds and the press hardening 30 seconds

It is assumed that transfer from the forming and quenching step also takes 6 seconds. This sums up to to a turnover time of 42 seconds. This leads to capacity of 6 kg/42 seconds or 0.51 t / h


It is assumed that the other machines have the capacity to allow continuous production

# Energy Demand

Meza-Garc√≠a et. al. {cite}`MezaGarcia.2019` provides theoretical energies for 300 seconds of operation. 

$$
E_{theo, heating} = 1867 kWs
$$
$$
E_{theo,forming} = 17503 kWs
$$

These are converted to real energies using the provided efficiency of 0.22:

$$
E_{real,heating} = 8.44 MJ
$$
$$
E_{real,forming} = 79.559 MJ
$$

Because these values are provided for 300 seconds of operation, they muss be converted to be mass specific to the product.
The specific energy demands are calculated by 

$$
E_{heating_mass}= \frac{E_{real,heating}}{300 s * 0.51 t/h}=198.61 MJ/t
$$
$$
E_{forming_mass}= \frac{E_{real,forming}}{300 s * 0.51 t/h}=1871.98 MJ/t
$$

For blanking and trimming no energy values are provided thus they are assumed to be:

$$
E_{real,blanking} = 0.2 * E_{forming_mass}= 374.396 MJ/t
$$
$$
E_{real,trimming} = 0.3 * E_{forming_mass} = 561.594 MJ/t
$$
