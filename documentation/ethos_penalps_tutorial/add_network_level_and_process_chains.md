# Add more network level and process chains

This sections explains how multiple process steps can be used in the simulation. They can be organized either sequentially or parallelly. Process steps that should be organized sequentially. 


Multiple network level are used to model sequential process steps. Multiple process chains within a network level are used to model parallel operation of process steps. In the case of a single machine an instance of each is sufficient.
