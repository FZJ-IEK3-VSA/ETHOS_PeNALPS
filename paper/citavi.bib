The dominating method for environmental impact assessments - life cycle assessment (LCA) lacks support to properly analyze the dynamic aspects of business operations and production processes. This Paper proposes to use discrete event simulation to support more extensive and detailed environmental assessments on selected parts of the production process, keeping simplicity for parts of less importance and interest.},

@misc{Ganapathy.2017,
 abstract = {In the present work, a new grip design for the Gleeble Materials-Simulator has been developed to reduce the long-standing problem of the temperature gradient during thermo-mechanical tensile testing. The deformation behaviour of 22MnB5 boron steel for a range of temperatures and strain rates were evaluated using the new test grip. Deformation results showed higher strain hardening (n-value) behaviour at low temperature compared to that at high temperature deformation, which increases the drawability of the material at low temperature hot stamping conditions. Moreover, hot stamping at high temperatures takes a longer time to cool the material below the martensitic finish temperature, which increases the die holding time and decreases productivity. To improve the formability and productivity of the hot stamping processes, the new hot stamping process at low temperatures was demonstrated. An automotive B-Pillar component was hot stamped at a wide range of temperatures and forming speeds, which included temperatures much lower than that of a normal hot stamping temperature range. To understand the influence of tool-workpiece contact pressure, tool and tool surface temperatures, and the effect of initial work-piece stamping temperature on in-die cooling time and tool surface temperature were investigated. A series tests of low-temperature hot stamping and heat transfer at different initial workpiece temperatures and contact pressure were carried out. The results confirmed that hot stamping could be performed at a lower temperature (500 °C) without compromising the part quality. It could also benefit the reduction of in-die quenching time by over 50{\%}, which would increase productivity for automotive mass production. In the process, material microstructural and thermomechanical behaviours can be carefully controlled to improve drawability and at the same time, to maintain or even enhance the post-form properties. Finally, unified viscoplastic constitutive equations were discussed, and material constants were determined. The viscoplastic constitutive material model was input into the finite element code, LS-DYNA, through a user defined subroutine and used for the simulation of hot stamping processes. The implemented viscoplastic constitutive model was accurate enough to predict the thickness distribution of a hot stamped product.},

However, while more or less detailed data on energy production is often available, appropriate data on energy consumption is often scarce. In our JERICHO-E-usage dataset, we provide comprehensive data on useful energy consumption patterns for heat, cold,~mechanical energy,~information and communication, and light in high spatial and temporal resolution. Furthermore, we distinguish between residential, industrial, commerce, and mobility consumers. For our dataset, we aggregate bottom-up data and disaggregate top-down data both to the NUTS2 level. The NUTS2 level serves as an interface to validate our combined method approach and the calculations. We combine a multitude of data sources such as weather time series, standard load profiles, census data, movement data, and employment figures to increase the scope, validity, and reproducibility for energy system modeling. The focus of our JERICHO-E-usage dataset on useful energy consumption might be of particular interest to researchers who analyze energy scenarios where renewable electricity is largely substituted for fossil fuel (sector coupling).},

@book{SallaLind.2009,
 abstract = {Digital engineering tools and procedures have had a positive impact on the European manufacturing industry. However, to design a sustainable manufacturing system, a multitude of system dimensions has to be jointly optimized. Manual work and automation are the complementary elements in the modern production systems. The increasing customization and shortening product lifecycle have led to smaller batch sizes and more varying products. The intelligence and adaptability of human workers make them the most flexible part of the production process. However, production must be optimized with respect to human wellbeing and environmental sustainability. In the Finnish-Swedish project SIMTER, we developed an integrated simulation tool helping to maximize production efficiency and to balance manual and automated work subject to ergonomics constraints. We examined human factors and environmental impacts as a part of production process optimization. The study based on an extensive literature review and collaboration with the companies, which included interviews, observations and tests with the SIMTER tool. The project's core result is the SIMTER simulation tool, which enables production simulation jointly taking into account levels of automation, ergonomics, and environmental impacts. The SIMTER tool enables dynamic simulations, instead of static simulations. During the project, we improved a digital human model, which relies on a database of measured and recorded real human motions. In addition, an environmental database was integrated with the simulation tool, so that environmental impact can be assessed while optimizing production. The assessment and choice of different levels of automation create the basis for the production optimization and simulation procedure.},
