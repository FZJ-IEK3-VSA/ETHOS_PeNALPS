 abstract = {Ecolabled products have shown a competitive advantage to other products. Regulatory changes and market pressure creates an increased need for environmental impact assessments. The dominating method for environmental impact assessments - life cycle assessment (LCA) lacks support to properly analyze the dynamic aspects of business operations and production processes. This Paper proposes to use discrete event simulation to support more extensive and detailed environmental assessments on selected parts of the production process, keeping simplicity for parts of less importance and interest.},

 abstract = {The analysis of energy scenarios for future energy systems requires appropriate data. However, while more or less detailed data on energy production is often available, appropriate data on energy consumption is often scarce. In our JERICHO-E-usage dataset, we provide comprehensive data on useful energy consumption patterns for heat, cold,~mechanical energy,~information and communication, and light in high spatial and temporal resolution. Furthermore, we distinguish between residential, industrial, commerce, and mobility consumers. For our dataset, we aggregate bottom-up data and disaggregate top-down data both to the NUTS2 level. The NUTS2 level serves as an interface to validate our combined method approach and the calculations. We combine a multitude of data sources such as weather time series, standard load profiles, census data, movement data, and employment figures to increase the scope, validity, and reproducibility for energy system modeling. The focus of our JERICHO-E-usage dataset on useful energy consumption might be of particular interest to researchers who analyze energy scenarios where renewable electricity is largely substituted for fossil fuel (sector coupling).},

@book{SallaLind.2009,
 abstract = {Digital engineering tools and procedures have had a positive impact on the European manufacturing industry. However, to design a sustainable manufacturing system, a multitude of system dimensions has to be jointly optimized. Manual work and automation are the complementary elements in the modern production systems. The increasing customization and shortening product lifecycle have led to smaller batch sizes and more varying products. The intelligence and adaptability of human workers make them the most flexible part of the production process. However, production must be optimized with respect to human wellbeing and environmental sustainability. In the Finnish-Swedish project SIMTER, we developed an integrated simulation tool helping to maximize production efficiency and to balance manual and automated work subject to ergonomics constraints. We examined human factors and environmental impacts as a part of production process optimization. The study based on an extensive literature review and collaboration with the companies, which included interviews, observations and tests with the SIMTER tool. The project's core result is the SIMTER simulation tool, which enables production simulation jointly taking into account levels of automation, ergonomics, and environmental impacts. The SIMTER tool enables dynamic simulations, instead of static simulations. During the project, we improved a digital human model, which relies on a database of measured and recorded real human motions. In addition, an environmental database was integrated with the simulation tool, so that environmental impact can be assessed while optimizing production. The assessment and choice of different levels of automation create the basis for the production optimization and simulation procedure.},

@book{Thiede.2012b,
 abstract = {{\textquotedbl}Energy consumption is of great interest to manufacturing companies. Beyond considering individual processes and machines, the perspective on process chains and factories as a whole holds major potentials for energy efficiency improvements. To exploit these potentials, dynamic interactions of different processes as well as auxiliary equipment (e.g. compressed air generation) need to be taken into account. In addition, planning and controlling manufacturing systems require  balancing technical, economic and environmental objectives. Therefore, an innovative and comprehensive methodology--with a generic energy flow-oriented manufacturing simulation environment as a core element--is developed and embedded into a step-by-step application cycle. The concept is applied in its entirety to a wide range of case studies such as aluminum die casting, weaving mills, and printed circuit board assembly in order to demonstrate the broad applicability and the benefits that can be achieved{\textquotedbl}--provided by publisher.},
